File/Directory | Description
--- | ---
*.exe | Executable file of the game
`*_Data` | Data folder containing the game resources
level0-levelN | Files containing game scenes data, each scene has its own file
sharedassets0-sharedassetsN | Game assets are split into sharedassets and .resS files (sharedassets.assets.split0 - ..splitN on platforms like Android/iOS)
resources.assets | Raw Assets found in the project resources folders and their dependencies are stored in this file (as well as raw audio files, even if outside of Resources folder in Unity, AudioClips with references to .resource and info such as audio size/offset still stored inside .assets)
`Managed` | Folder containing unity DLLs
Assembly-CSharp.dll | DLL file containing compiled C# files
Assembly-UnityScript.dll | DLL file containing compiled UnityScript files

With ``*`` : The name of the main executable (.exe).


## Extracting and editing code

C# and UnityScript files are compiled into the Assembly-CSharp.dll and Assembly-UnityScript.dll DLLs respectively, which can be found inside the `Managed` folder.

DLLs can be decompiled using ILSpy, dnSpy, DotPeek or JustAssembly which allow modifying and recompiling assembly files.

If DLLs are missing from the managed directory, try dumping them using ``MegaDumper`` tool.

## Extracting assets

Assets are stored in the .assets and .resS files.
Content of these files can be unpacked with one of these tools :

[Unity Assets Explorer](https://zenhax.com/viewtopic.php?t=36) <br /> ![No Longer Maintained](https://img.shields.io/badge/No%20Longer%20Maintained-red.svg) | Unity Assets Explorer is used to view the contents of Assets-files (Unity 3D engine). Allows you to: Extract all files, extract one file (from context menu), convert tex-files into a picture format DDS (on extraction), import the changed DDS-images to the archive.

> **Do not use UnityEX**, it is most likely a virus.

### DDS files :

The [DDS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DirectDraw_Surface) files can be opened/converted/edited with the following tools :

## Hacking memory

Cheat engine have a feature called [Dissect mono](https://wiki.cheatengine.org/index.php?title=Mono) that can help hacking game's memory. This [video series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNffuWEygffbue0tvx7IusDmfAthqmgS7) about using cheat engine is really useful.
